Welcome to Wonder Donation!

1. Your relationship with Wonder Donation

1.1 Your use of Wonder Donation’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Wonder Donation under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Wonder Donation. “Wonder Donation” means Wonder Donation Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Wonder Donation, your agreement with Wonder Donation will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.

1.3 Your agreement with Wonder Donation will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Wonder Donation in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.

1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

2. Accepting the Terms

    2.1 In order to use the Services, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.

    2.2 You can accept the Terms by:

        (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Wonder Donation in the user interface for any Service; or

        (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Wonder Donation will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

    2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Wonder Donation, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.

    2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.

3. Language of the Terms

    3.1 Where Wonder Donation has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Wonder Donation.

    3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.

4. Provision of the Services by Wonder Donation

    4.1 Wonder Donation has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Wonder Donation itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.

    4.2 Wonder Donation is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Wonder Donation provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.

    4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Wonder Donation may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Wonder Donation’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Wonder Donation when you stop using the Services.

    4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Wonder Donation disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.

    4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while Wonder Donation may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Wonder Donation at any time, at Wonder Donation’s discretion.

5. Use of the Services by you

    5.1 In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any registration information you give to Wonder Donation will always be accurate, correct and up to date.

    5.2 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

    5.3 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Wonder Donation, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Wonder Donation.

    5.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).

    5.5 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Wonder Donation, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.

This policy explains how Wonder Donation treats your personal information, and protects your privacy, when you use the Services.

    7.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Wonder Donation’s privacy policies.

8. Content in the Services

    8.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the “Content”.

    8.2 You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content to Wonder Donation (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Wonder Donation or by the owners of that Content, in a separate agreement.

    8.3 Wonder Donation reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service. For some of the Services, Wonder Donation may provide tools to filter out explicit sexual content. These tools include the SafeSearch preference settings (see http://www.Wonder Donation.co.uk/help/customize.html#safe). In addition, there are commercially available services and software to limit access to material that you may find objectionable.

    8.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.

    8.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Wonder Donation has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Wonder Donation may suffer) by doing so.

9. Proprietary rights

    9.1 You acknowledge and agree that Wonder Donation (or Wonder Donation’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by Wonder Donation and that you shall not disclose such information without Wonder Donation’s prior written consent.

    9.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Wonder Donation, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Wonder Donation’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

    9.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Wonder Donation, then you agree that your use of such features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Wonder Donation's brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time. These guidelines can be viewed online at http://www.Wonder Donation.com/permissions/guidelines.html (or such other URL as Wonder Donation may provide for this purpose from time to time).

    9.4 Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, Wonder Donation acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Wonder Donation, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Wonder Donation has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

    9.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.

    9.6 Unless you have been expressly authorised to do so in writing by Wonder Donation, you agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organisation in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorised user of such marks, names or logos.

10. Licence from Wonder Donation

    10.1 Wonder Donation gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by Wonder Donation as part of the Services as provided to you by Wonder Donation (referred to as the “Software” below). This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Wonder Donation, in the manner permitted by the Terms.

    10.2 You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Wonder Donation, in writing.

    10.3 Unless Wonder Donation has given you specific written permission to do so, you may not assign (or grant a sub-licence of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software.

11. Content licence from you

    11.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying the content you give Wonder Donation a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive licence to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling Wonder Donation to display, distribute and promote the Services and may be revoked for certain Services as defined in the Additional Terms of those Services.

You agree that this licence shall permit Wonder Donation to take these actions.

You agree to receive such updates (and permit Wonder Donation to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Services.

13. Ending your relationship with Wonder Donation

    13.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Wonder Donation as set out below.

    13.2 If you want to terminate your legal agreement with Wonder Donation, you may do so by (a) notifying Wonder Donation at any time and (b) closing your accounts for all of the Services which you use, where Wonder Donation has made this option available to you. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to Wonder Donation’s address which is set out at the beginning of these Terms.

    13.3 Wonder Donation may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:
